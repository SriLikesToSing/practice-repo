what are computers in the physical sense?
	
	- electro-mechanical devices that try to simulate broadly what computation
	is

	- it all starts with charles babbage's analytical engine
		- a complete machine that could be a general purpose computing device.
			- made entirely of brass driven by a shaft powered by a steam
			engine

			- was base 10 because it could unlike modern systems 
				- contained 40 decimal digits
			- 40 wheels with 10 positions 0-9

			- a 41st wheel represented the sign, even numbers were positive
			and else negative

			- to prevent accumulatd error, it used lockings to lock certain
			pivots into place.
				- however this could not account for physical wear such as
				friction, inefficient conversion to mechanical energy, and
				wear and tear.

			- a music box type crank system was used to operate the "CPU"
			which has instructions that was given through a punch card.

	ENIAC (The electornic numerical integrator and computer):
		- consumed 150 kilowatts of energy
		- also used based 10 representation
		- used punch card reader for input and outputs
		- had 20 "registers" that were called accumulators 

		- did this machine have memory? 
			- no, not other than the accumulators

		- interesting part is that john von neumann proposed his architecutre
		with this device. 

			Von neumann architecure in an nutshell:
				- a memory pool containing program instructions and data 
				- arithmetic logic and registers
				- control unit containing instruction pointer and program
				counter

	IBM PC:
		
		- transister was invented in 1947 by intel founders?
			- vast improvment over vaccum tubes
				- what are vaccum tubes? (thermionic valves)
					- so you're telling me all computers essentially came from
					light bulbs....

					- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube
					- https://www.engineering.com/story/vacuum-tubes-the-world-before-transistors

					- the basic principle of vaccum tubes were based on
					something called thermionic emission
						- what is thermionic emission (edison effect)
							- you heat up an electrode and releases electrons 
							into the medium
								- this occurs because the thermal energy given
								to the free moving charge carrier in a
								conductor overcomes the work function of the
								conductor.
									- what is a charge carrier?
										- what is an ion?
											- ion is a particle with some net
											electrical charge
												- electron has -1 
												- hole has +1

										- these charge charriers are moved by
										an electric field that can exert force
									and move these particles through a medium.
									This is more known as an electric current.

									- what is a work function?
										- is the minimum thermodynamic work
										needed to remove an electron from a
										solid to a point in a vaccum.

					- A vaccume tube consisting of only two electrodes is
					called a diode. 
						- A diode is an electrical component that allows for a
						one way flow off current 
							- diodes are used to convert AC to DC (rectifier)

				   - A triode has three electrodes, and allows you to amplify
				   circuits




					- outside is a glass tube
					-inside this tube contains a heated chathode heater, a
					grid surrounding it, an anode

						- what is an anode?

							- what is an electrode?
							
								- a type of electrical conducter used to
								make contact with a nonmetallic part of a
								circuit

									- there is anode, cathode and
									dielectric cell

										- anode: electrode through which
										conventional current enters from
										the elctrical circuit into non
										metallic cell - 

										- cathode: electrode in which
										current enters from non metallic
										to electrical circuit + 


								- what is an electrical conductor?
									- an object or material that allows
								for the flow of charge in directions
										- this movement creates current

									
									- essentially for current to flow in a
									closed circuit, you just need the
									charged particles to nudge its
									neighbors, essentially transferring
									momentum, until the particle is nudged
									into the load.
.
									- what is charge?

										- a property of matter using the
										symbol "q" that allows
										it to experience a certain force
										when put inside an electromagnetic
										field

										- electric charges can be
										postitive or negative
											- like charges repel, and
											unlike charges attract

											- 0 net charge is called
											electrically neutral

										- the net charge of an isolated
										system is conserved	
										
										- electric charge is carried by
										subatomic particles
											- negative charge is carried
											by electrons**

											-postive charge is carried by
											protons
												- inside nuclei of atoms

										- charge can be quantized by the
										unit elementary charge "e", which
										is about 1.602 x 10^-9 C or
										Coloumbs  or Ampere*hour<----
										smallest charge that can exist
										freely
											- ion is an atom with net
											positive charge. Anion is the
											opposite.
												

										- electric charges produce
										electric fields and moving charges
										produces magnetic fields
											- a combination of these
											produces electromagnetic force


										- what is matter?
											- matter is anything with mass
											and volume
												
												- what is mass?
													- there conceptually
													seems to be at least 7
													concepts of mass
														- these 7 types
														are all shown to
														be propotional or
														outright equal


													- the one from newtons
													second law uses
													interial mass
														- interial mass is
														the objects
														tendency to resist
														acceleration
													
													- what is the
													difference between
													interial and
													gravitational mass?
														- although they
														are conceptually
														distinct its not
														experimentally
														proven otherwise	
														- classical
														mechanics does not
													offer a compelling
													reason why they should
													be equal

														- einstien
														devloped
														relativity with
														the assumption
														that interial and
														gravitaional
														masses are the
														same
															- equating
															this is often
															called the
															galilean
															equivalence
															principle or
															the weak
															equivalence
															principle 

															- what is
															gravitational
															mass?
																- active
																gravitational
																mass:
																	- measure
																	of
																	strength
																	of
																	gravitational
																	flux
																		- what
																		is
																		gravitational
																		flux?
																			- basically
																			measures
																			how
																			much
																			"gravity"
																			pours
																			into
																			the
																			window
																			that
																			is
																			the
																			gravitational
																			field
																			- what
																			is
																			flux?
																				- surface
																				integral
																				describing
																				the
																				flow
																				of
																				the
																				surface
																				(the
																				 summation
																				 of
																				 the
																				 directions
																				 of
																				 a
																				 manifold)
																					- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/929149/intuitively-how-do-you-explain-the-concept-of-flux


																	 - gravitational
																	 flux
																	 is
																	 equivalent
																	 to
																	 newtons
																	 universal
																	 law
																	 of
																	 gravitation
																		- the flux
																		over
																		any
																		gravitational
																		field
																		is
																		propotional
																		to
																		the
																		mass
																		enclosed
																		over
																		a
																		closed
																		surface
																		
																- passive
																gravitational
																mass:
																	- measure
																	of the
																	strenght
																	of an
																	objects
																	interaction
																	with a
																	gravitational
																	field
																		- weight/acceleration
																		- two
																		objects
																		in
																		the
																		same
																		gravitational
																		field
																		will
																		experience
																		different
																		forces
																		based
																		on
																		the
																		weight
																	


												- what is volume?
													- volume is generally
													thought of as the
													amount of fluid gas or
													liquid that the
													container could hold,
													rather than the amount
													of space the container
													displaces.
