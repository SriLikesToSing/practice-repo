what are computers in the physical sense?
	
	- electro-mechanical devices that try to simulate broadly what computation
	is

	- it all starts with charles babbage's analytical engine
		- a complete machine that could be a general purpose computing device.
			- made entirely of brass driven by a shaft powered by a steam
			engine

			- was base 10 because it could unlike modern systems 
				- contained 40 decimal digits
			- 40 wheels with 10 positions 0-9

			- a 41st wheel represented the sign, even numbers were positive
			and else negative

			- to prevent accumulatd error, it used lockings to lock certain
			pivots into place.
				- however this could not account for physical wear such as
				friction, inefficient conversion to mechanical energy, and
				wear and tear.

			- a music box type crank system was used to operate the "CPU"
			which has instructions that was given through a punch card.

	ENIAC (The electornic numerical integrator and computer):
		- consumed 150 kilowatts of energy
		- also used based 10 representation
		- used punch card reader for input and outputs
		- had 20 "registers" that were called accumulators 

		- did this machine have memory? 
			- no, not other than the accumulators

		- interesting part is that john von neumann proposed his architecutre
		with this device. 

			Von neumann architecure in an nutshell:
				- a memory pool containing program instructions and data 
				- arithmetic logic and registers
				- control unit containing instruction pointer and program
				counter

	IBM PC:
		
		- transister was invented in 1947 by intel founders?
			- vast improvment over vaccum tubes
				- what are vaccum tubes?
					- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube
						- outside is a glass tube
						-inside this tube contains a heated chathode heater, a
						grid surrounding it, an anode
							- what is an anode?
								- what is an electrode?
									- what is an electrical conductor?
										- what is charge?
											- what is matter?
												- matter is anything with mass
												and volume
													- what is mass?
														- there conceptually
														seems to be at least 7
														concepts of mass
															- these 7 types
															are all shown to
															be propotional or
															outright equal


														- the one from newtons
														second law uses
														interial mass
															- interial mass is
															the objects
															tendency to resist
															acceleration
														
														- what is the
														difference between
														interial and
														gravitational mass?
															- although they
															are conceptually
															distinct its not
															experimentally
															proven otherwise	
															- classical
															mechanics does not
														offer a compelling
														reason why they should
														be equal

															- einstien
															devloped
															relativity with
															the assumption
															that interial and
															gravitaional
															masses are the
															same
																- equating
																this is often
																called the
																galilean
																equivalence
																principle or
																the weak
																equivalence
																principle 

																- what is
																gravitational
																mass?
																	- active
																	gravitational
																	mass:
																		- measure
																		of
																		strength
																		of
																		gravitational
																		flux
																			- what
																			is
																			gravitational
																			flux?
																				- what
																				is
																				flux?
																					- surface
																					integral
																					describing
																					the
																					flow
																					of
																					the
																					surface
																					(the
																					 summation
																					 of
																					 the
																					 directions
																					 of
																					 a
																					 manifold)

																	- passive
																	gravitational
																	mass:


													- what is volume?
